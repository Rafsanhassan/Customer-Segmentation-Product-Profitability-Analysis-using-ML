# Retail Customer Segmentation and Product Analysis

## Project Overview
Analysis of retail purchase behavior and transaction data to identify high-value customer segments and top-performing products using K-Means clustering machine learning algorithm.

## Business Problem
The marketing department needed insights to:
- Identify the most profitable customer segments
- Understand characteristics of loyal customers
- Determine top-selling products to optimize marketing strategy

## Dataset
The analysis uses two key datasets:
1. `purchase_behaviour.csv` - Customer demographic data including lifestyle stage and customer type
2. `transaction_data.csv` - Detailed transaction records including product info and sales data

## Key Findings
- Identified top 3 revenue-generating products in the snack category
- Dorito Corn Chips Supreme (380g) leads sales at $40,352
- Large format packages (330g-380g) dominate top sales
- Customer segmentation revealed distinct purchasing patterns

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for K-Means clustering
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

## Analysis Techniques
- Data preprocessing and merging
- Feature engineering
- K-Means clustering for customer segmentation
- Statistical analysis of product performance
